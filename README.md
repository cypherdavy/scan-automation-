# üîç Automated Vulnerability Scanner

This project uses a custom shell script (`scan.sh`) to automate the process of:
1. Enumerating subdomains.
2. Checking live subdomains.
3. Scanning for medium and critical vulnerabilities using **Nuclei**.

---

## üöÄ Tools Used

- **Nuclei** - A fast and customizable vulnerability scanner based on simple YAML templates.
- **ProjectDiscovery Templates** - A rich collection of community-driven templates for scanning.
- **Bash** - For automation via `scan.sh`.

---

## üß™ Scan Workflow

The script performs the following tasks:

1. **Subdomain Enumeration**
2. **Live Subdomain Detection**
3. **Nuclei Vulnerability Scan**
   - Medium & critical severity
   - Over 2800 templates loaded
   - Uses both signed and unsigned templates
